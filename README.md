westpac-quickpay
================

Personal app to quickly make payments via Westpac NZ.

Not really for anyone to use, just me because I hate logging in and making payments all the time. It should be easier.

Notes: I had to hack a part of `NJKWebViewProgress.m` (see Pods). If you want this to work, youâ€™ll need to remove anything to do with iframes in the middle of `- (void)webViewDidFinishLoad:(UIWebView *)webView`
